## Branch protection rules

Set up branch protection rules for the default branch with the following rules:

- Pull request is needed
- Minimum 2 approvals
- Review needed from code owners

## Branch naming

The default branch should be `main`.

## DCO

There is a DCO app set up on kptdev organisation level, so no setting is needed on indivitual repo level.
